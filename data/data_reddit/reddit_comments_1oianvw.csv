【内容】
Hi, I am but surprised how many people complain about the job market but recently we've been searching for senior developers in Germany mainly.


We got 150 applications, 70% did not read the job post and doesn't have the required experience and skills or doesn't have a valid work permit, the other 30% were calling them selves seniors but infact they failed at the very first questions.


Our interview is very simple, no algos no data structure nothing and in English, no German is required.


It is just weird"
1oianvw,comment,nlu0lqb,1oianvw,emmmmmmaja,Hamburg,2025-10-28 22:26:02,555,"I think there’s two things here: 

a) you‘re looking for a senior developer. Most people who come on here asking about the job market either have zero work experience or so little that they still fall into the junior category. The job market for seniors is not that terrible. 

b) The fact that the job market for juniors is so terrible can actually increase the number of unfit applicants you’re seeing. When the market is bad, more people will go „fuck it, I‘ll apply anyway, it can’t get worse than a No“."

I bet a large number of that 70% is just clicking EasyApply on everything. "

I don’t think I interviewed a single person who applied via a one click method from LinkedIn or Indeed."
1oianvw,comment,nm006ib,nlw5fhd,FitResource5290,,2025-10-29 20:52:15,3,Just curious: did you actually read all 350 applications?

All in all a pretty small project "
1oianvw,comment,nlyvsd4,nlv4iq6,Hardkoar,,2025-10-29 15:08:45,46,"And why shouldn't they just hit the fast apply button when companies are hitting the auto-reply back?

Some even scripting it to auto-reply after 12h to make it look more realistic lol. It's a shit show on both ends, just like op if his company actually offered an interesting salary they would have attracted senior devs. 

Then you see companies offering 40k ""we got fruit basket"" for senior devs complain they are getting junior candidates."
1oianvw,comment,nlzbjsr,nlv4iq6,schelmo,,2025-10-29 17:50:03,1,True. My brother is a department lead at a fairly renowned research institute and even before chatGPT easily half the applications he got for any position were complete slop because tons international students apply to jobs they're not even close to qualified for because the institute will look good on their CV when they return home. We're talking about people who are in their second semester of their electrical engineering bachelor applying for jobs that specifically require a PhD in physics. The amount of slop applications he gets has only increased since LLMs became a thing.
1oianvw,comment,nmdllnz,nlu0lqb,YourMomCannotAnymore,,2025-10-31 22:35:49,1,"In some roles seniors are so rare because everyone hates doing that job. Usually the market isn't bad for that kind of position, otherwise you'll struggle even with experience."

1oianvw,comment,nlubfql,nlu16zb,SilverSize7852,,2025-10-28 23:20:23,99,Yeah cause thr job market for graduates/juniors is so bad that ppl apply for any IT position they see
1oianvw,comment,nlucvdo,nlu16zb,Dry_Hotel1100,,2025-10-28 23:27:22,78,"Define \*basic\* question. Please give an example.

The point is, there are literally *thousands* of ""basic"" questions, and usually a senior dev won't be busy with ""basic"" stuff all the time where you are asking questions.

So, a basic question in your mind could be: ""Can you use radix sort for Doubles - and what's a potential issue with this?"" for someone who is into algorithms.  
However, this would not be a \*basic\* question for a front-end developer who has 10 YoE in several web development tech stacks."
1oianvw,comment,nlvqyhp,nlucvdo,G3sch4n,,2025-10-29 03:29:04,27,"Static questions are probably the worst way to find out if a senior developer is skilled. You can not determine how fast somebody is able to apply new technologies to new problems. You can not determine how good somebody is at helping and guiding junior developers (which is part of the job of a senior developer).

Way to often these interviews come down to how much you have studied the technical documentation of a certain framework/language instead of checking how flexible your thinking is."
1oianvw,comment,nlvv5nx,nlvqyhp,Dry_Hotel1100,,2025-10-29 03:50:01,10,"Yeah, it's also the little things where you surprisingly struggle with. For example, I do know Swift programming language very well (since 2014). Just today, I unexpectedly struggled hard with initialising an array.

Read twice: initialising an array, well with random double values. Well, I wanted to do it without looking into the docs or even use AI and not using the compilers help. I know how to do it in an efficient way - I thought, but then the details struck me: how was the initialiser's name again, what parameters did the closure require, did the closure return the number of initialised elements, or was it an inout parameter of the closure? Can I use the subscript operator (Integer) for the provided buffer?, etc. etc.   It's a two liner. It hit me.

Now imagine, I do a code interview ..."

Dunning Kruger Effect will make lots of people with little experience overestimate themselves. 

Also, small consultancies will sometimes promote employees to senior just so they can sell a senior engineer to their customers (and then this person can legitimately put this title into their CV)."

Basic questions should try to find people that are matching your basic expectations…"
1oianvw,comment,nluckgl,1oianvw,diamanthaende,,2025-10-28 23:25:55,71,"The market for juniors is ass because a) companies don't have the time (= money) to invest in them and b) it's completely oversaturated, tons and tons of quantity and little quality. IT has become the new BWL, which means that finding those who are actually passionate about it has become a lot more difficult. So even if you want to find talented juniors, it's a needle in the haystack situation.

Seniors and mid-level professionals have it easier, provided that they actually know their stuff and are not self-proclaimed. Our company, despite the times not being the easiest, hired a dozen new devs this year - completely new jobs, not replacements of retirees etc. But none of those were juniors.

For juniors, we prefer ""Duales Studium"" Azubis that we basically train and prepare ""in house"". Way less risk involved and easier to find those that actually fit in."
1oianvw,comment,nluv6xs,nluckgl,DE_Auswanderung,,2025-10-29 00:55:34,6,"Can a portion of ""self-proclaimed"" skills be acquired by lots of self-studying at the current job (because one is not directly involved in the exercise of those skills on a project with the current employer)?

1oianvw,comment,nluzfmg,nlu0evl,DrProfSrRyan,Baden-Württemberg ,2025-10-29 01:15:36,42,"Probably, also because „senior“ isn’t necessarily a standardized term in every country at every company. 

Plus, even if you just look at experience, there is a large spread between 5 years at Google and 5 years at a failed start-up in India.

There was a guy on here recently looking, and failing, to find a job as a senior developer with 2 years of experience just because his previous company called him a senior.

He considered it a demotion to look for an junior role."

1oianvw,comment,nlvu1p4,1oianvw,Professional-Fee-957,,2025-10-29 03:44:29,45,"I think the biggest issue is, just like you, every single job ad is for seniors, and they want senior seniors, 10yrs+, but will settle for a really really promising 7 years, maybe.

Nobody is taking juniors unless it is ""junior position - 5 years experience"". That means you have hundreds of junior engineers not getting positions and a whole lot of mid-level engineers refusing to demote to junior and are trying their best to get senior.

While your post is interesting, you fail to take the effect this prolonged tech job crash has had on the levels of desperation within the applicant pool."

They do settle, that's true. I've seen companies that advertise for seniors, and will hire someone with only 3 YOE who aced the interview, and award them the senior title.

Also, from experience, I've seen lots of 20-somethings being far better skilled at DSA and technical stuff compared to 15YOE+ veterans, just because they have a lot of energy and curiosity, and free time to code in their personal time."
1oianvw,comment,nmdnf88,nm5yux7,YourMomCannotAnymore,,2025-10-31 22:45:04,1,"I mean, it's incredibly dumb for a company (OP should know this really well, or I doubt their company will survive for long) to stick to pre-set criteria (especially number of years) when selecting personnel. Yes, you add some restrictions if you get a lot of candidates and you're bad at organizing to the point you can't even make time to interview 20% of the applicants. In the case of OP, who claims they struggle to find unicors, they should compromise and check the other candidates because it's very likely they are only selecting liars or the most incompetent from the lot they got, while ignoring someone who has 1 month less experience than they'd need to for OP to consider them ""seniors"".

I was recently looking for a new job too, senior with more than 10 years xp. I can tell, some offers were a slap in the face. I wouldn't even accept that as newbie. Also there were not many job offers that would even fit remotely when you are specialized to some point."

I got my new job through recruiters or the HR person approached me directly. And I actually expect some sort of effort from the companies side too.

1oianvw,comment,nphdiac,npdobcl,SolidDeveloper,,2025-11-18 20:35:06,1,"Yes, but the point is that for people who do have high salaries, changing jobs for a 50% pay cut is a definite deal-breaker. I will never apply for those low paid Staff+ roles that I mentioned, and it may be that those employers are wondering, just like OP is, why they’re not getting quality candidates. Well this is why.

And even the qualified people who have been laid off might not apply for those low paid roles, because they know how much work and stress they involve, so they will just not want to bother for that compensation. "

This is your interpretation. To my understanding the 70% is in total:

*  Did not read the job post, or
* Not required skill or
* Missing work permit

We both don’t know, how percentages of the rejection reasons.. So I would not make false assumptions.

In my previous job, I was an engineering manager, and was involved in the hiring. We also received it pre-filtered.

* There where lots of Indians applying for the job, even when they are not located here..
* There were people applying for seniors with only a couple years of experience
* An SAP consultant applying for a frontend position.

When you assume, in your bullet points for rejection that one point being ""did not read the job post"" and another being ""not required skills"" you automatically assume their HR is familliar with what's needed and understand the difference is someone applied to a Java + Spring position asking for 5years, the HR person knows if the candidate with 6 years of SpringBoot and Hibernates is a fit or not.

The company just needs to provide an employment contract and maybe like one other form.  There's no external costs for the employer to do this.  People from some countries outside of the EU can even apply for jobs in Germany while visiting on a tourist visa and then use their employment contract to get a work residency.

There’s no doubt that number of openings across the board is down compared to last few years, but it’s amplified by the fog of Ai slop which makes a scenario where you have to apply to hundreds of places to be lucky enough for someone to respond to you.

It is true that when someone posts a position on LinkedIn it receives mass applications that are not even tailored to the job description, I’ve been on the side of helping recruiters filter candidates.

However, some areas are indeed saturated, specifically front-end development, and this is the line where I think some recruiters are failing to grasp that it’s better and less costly to hire a senior developer who doesn’t have exactly all the right buzzwords or trending libraries in their CVs and train them rather than keep looking for the exact match. Last interviews I did I failed because someone saw I had experience with some adjacent technology more than 10 years ago and expected me to remember and keep up to date with the latest advancements in that field which was not even relevant to the position I was applying for.

It’s an employers' market now and most of the positions are looking for 3 roles or more in one.

Even if they make it somehow on technical interviews (which are fully based on real world problems and context we’re in, not some google algo or leet code bullshit), almost all of them fail on social / leadership parts … Makes us really appreciate people we have in the company that are truly seasoned and old school seniors who get shit done with no fuss."

1oianvw,comment,nm50ts5,1oianvw,Desperate_Mine_3472,,2025-10-30 12:34:44,1,I just wanted to know where I stand. I have been reading a lot of posts where the people are struggling to find a job in germany I was planning to go there for master’s solely because I want to study (not that I want to escape the job market) I have a job right now in india at a wealth management firm as a junior software engineer although the department is very new here and my senior left the org. I am currently leading a portfolio analysis platform development for my organisation and after piloting it as an internal tool the plan is to expand it as a b2b solution. I am also working on a side project. What can I expect from germany in terms of growth going forward. I would really like to work at an automobile company in software. For this sole reason I was thinking of pivoting a bit to hardware integration too but since I am leading this project I am really liking this financial engineering field as well but I don’t think I should pursue it as a degree. Reading on this subreddit really makes me question my future.

Please stop pretending this is anything other than Xenophobia. It's disgusting that some recruiters only want applicants with a EU citizenship. I honestly don't understand how that kind of blatant discrimination based on one's country of origin is even legal. That's part of the reason the job market is hell rn."

And you expect them  to answers highly Technical questions, as if during the job you arent allowed to use google or research back home to deal with specific issues.

This entire industry is a joke. If you work in HR, or conduct techincal interviews, please quit aswell. People like you, who are making such dumb questions, shouldn't be working in HR.

Stupidity should be disqualifying for employers aswell."

You think people don't realise you just spat out a low effort CV without being remotely qualified for the job? 

Look for a position that actually suits you and then put some effort into an Anschreiben and I guarantee you will be in top 10% of applicants already.

Or keep shitting out ten applications a day for positions you're not qualified for and then complain about not finding a job."

Secondly, tailor making your CV specific for thst company is a waste of time.

Looking for positions that suit you will exhaust all of those positions very fast. But this post is erong to talk about this because this is for a senior position. 

&gt;Or keep shitting out ten applications a day for positions you're not qualified for and then complain about not finding a job.

1oianvw,comment,nlu5l4o,nlu1tz4,tejanaqkilica,Albania,2025-10-28 22:51:29,6,"HR rarely pulls questions or requirements out of their ass. If the IT Department is looking for someone with a certain skillset, that skillset is going to be provided to HR by the IT department.

Also, in the interviews that my company has conducted, there was always someone from IT present in the interview, precisely for the technical questions.

If we're hiring someone for the heldesk role and I ask him what's best for X scenario, LACP or Round Robin and he says he needs to Google what those are first, that's fine, there's nothing wrong with finding more information before giving an answer.

If we're hiring a senior network engineer and he says that, well he isn't nowhere near senior level.

Germany lacks qualified IT personnel, some people refuse to see it or are too over confident in their abilities."

Going to reddit,  and saying hmm I dont see it, is so ignorant.

This is the same logic as saying, well its cold today, therefore people compaling about summer being too hot is fake.

Your anecdotal case, including the fact this is a senior position, there are hundreds of senior openings, is a non factor for most.

Most people arent 15 YoE seniors.

Most complaints dont come from unemployed seniors."

It’s like saying I created an amazing advert for hand sanitizer and it’s amazing, but the only people engaging are those who don’t use hand sanitizers!!

Where the F Is your HR woman advertising these position? Who wrote out the JD? What does it say specifically? And did you screen the CV’s your self?

150 CV’s is a joke. Your dumb ass HR most probably doesn’t know how to do their job. Find someone else! On average every job posted these days on LI and elsewhere get over a 1000 applications. I have heard the same from people in HR Say the same and seen it first hand in my last company. 

Advertised 4 roles- intern in finance, junior designer, financial control manager and a director asset management- all received over 800 applications in two days. Out incompetent HR stopped reviewing after finding three qualified candidates that could be put forward to interview. It was a shameful sight to see because a lot of interns put in some good effort for their CV’s and cover letters. But were even read by our useless HR TEAM"
