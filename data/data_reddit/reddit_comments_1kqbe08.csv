【内容】
Had several discussions with management about use of AI and what controls may be needed moving forward.

These generally end up being pushed at IT to solve when IT is the one asking all the questions of the business as to what use cases are we trying to solve.

Should the business own the policy or is it up to IT to solve? Anyone had any luck either way?"

Were I in your shoes and I was being put on the spot to make a decision, I’d put my wishlist together… and my wishlist would be 1 line:

Full corporate ban on the use of LLMs, SLMs, generative AI, general AI, and all other AI models currently and yet to be created with punitive actions to include immediate dismissal of employment.

And the only way this policy is reversed is once the general public understands the ramifications of AI use and data security. This will hopefully result in management and HR rolling their eyes and deciding it’s just best to consult IT with technical questions and leaving policy making with them."

We would however, detail the risks and propose controls and detail negative outcomes so Legal/whoever can make an informed risk decision, and then maintain controls going forward.

Or I'll have it search the source code for something to find an option that isn't documented, which I had to do a bit with pgCat. Lots of times I'm also using it to learn, asking it to test me on something and I will check my understanding that way. Claude once got an RBAC implementation in Kubernetes correct while Deepseek R1 got it wrong, though! And sometimes I'll run architectural questions to a couple different LLMs to see if they give me any ideas or they correct me on something. I also recently asked Claude if an idea I had with Facebook's Faiss would work and it pumped out 370 lines of Python code to test and execute my idea which worked. But that is code that's not going to be used. I'm just going to use it as a guideline and re-write all of it since I need to actually double-check everything. I didn't even ask it to write anything!

The first sniffs our network for irregularities. It constantly sniffs all workstations/servers logging behavior. When a non common behavior occurs it documents it and depending on the severity shits the network down on that workstation/server. So examples of why it would shut the network down on that device could range from and end users stealing data onto a thumb drive to a ransomware attack. 

We have a 2nd AI that sniffs our emails. It also learns patterns of who we receive email from. It is able to check hyperlinks for mailciousness and lick the hyperlink if needex, check files and convert the document as needed, identify malicious emails, and so much more.

While a human can do these tasks, it would take 10+ humans to provide the same amount of time invested to do all of these things. I was never offered 10 extra people, it was me and 1 other person handling these 2 roles. Now we have AI assisting for half the cost of 1 other human, but providing us the power of 10 humans.

Genuinely curious what the AI is to your examples as opposed to more standard email AV/intrusion detection solutions, as they can also check for dodgy hyperlinks and the like. And the same for the network. Sounds very similar to what SCOM could be set up to do.

Management should also understand the risks to business that they may not be aware of if they aren't versed in IT language.  It is not a black and white discussion and both sides have to discuss and solution the policy to what makes sense for the business.  Every business is going to be different but without understanding the risks and benefits from all sides will this be solved

IT should be at the table to advise what the implications are and what resources are likely needed.  Then ELT can decide from there and IT can deploy.

The way we do it at my place: all new software with AI components has to be evaluated by IT. If IT doesn’t have the staff or time to get to the eval right away then the business doesn’t get that AI component until IT can properly evaluate it and provide a risk assessment. If the business goes around IT and takes the risk anyway - that’s not IT’s fault.

Edit: replaced “evil” with “eval” - though it could have worked either way."

Every CEO is on Twitter reading folks like Aaron Levie (Box CEO) and Tobi Lutke (Shopify CEO) talk about AI enabled productivity and how AI adoption is a strategic imperative. That means AI tools are going to mushroom super fast in your orgs and IT/compliance/security can't be seen as the productivity killing police.

But of course, these shiny new apps are shipping with zero enterprise-grade controls - no SAML, no SCIM, often not even usable user admin controls. So every tool and account turns into a one-off headache. 

Bottom line IMHO: IT/Security/Compliance can't wait for the business to define the policy here.

In my firm - my team look after Data and Compliance (so DPO and associated functions)

Policy first for using AI, any tooling that uses it needs to approved where reasonable i.e Google Search wouldn't be within scope, but Chat GPT would be. Staff cannot setup accounts on systems on behalf of the business, nor share anything relating to the company including PII, IP or internal communications/materials. And we obviously, very strict on this.

Second to that, all systems we use must be protectable by SSO/IDP. This somewhat limits what systems we can use which is useful.

All applications must go on a risk register, and be accountable and auditable. We save all privacy policies and only approve applications where our data can be validated end to end (so we get data flow diagrams e.t.c) along with ensuring that our data does not get shared into any collective LLM.

It took our 3 man team 72 hours pretty much straight to rebuild and recover our data. We had to shut our business down those 3 days. I had a 13 hour phone call with our AV company during that time!

That will never happen again. This AI will drop the network of whatever device is corrupted to keep it from spreading. During business hours, we have to take action on 75% of the issues. But after business hours we have something watching for irregularities and stopping anything needed. 

Being afraid of AI, you might think it is a bad idea, but it has been nothing but a benefit to our company. This new email AI I have fallen in love with. We had our shit so locked down it wasn't even funny. We were able to remove the majority of blocks and let the AI do the job. 

Before, any office (word, excel, etc) files were blocked by default. Now, AI scans the file and if it feels it is malicious in any way it converts the attachment to something not malicious. For instance an xlsx file in question would convert to csv. They could still get their data, but it removes the macros, etc same with pdfs. It does the same with links. Vets the link and if it is deemed malicious, it locks the link so they can't click it. This allows content to get to employees and if it was actually legit they can request the original.

IT and technology departments will of course have to play a big role. They'll probably be responsible for a lot of integration work, as well as the technical implementation of policies (blocks or whatever). But the company as a whole needs to figure out what makes sense for each area and where to draw lines.

You probably need a small group with IT, InfoSec, HR, and representation from the revenue generting sections of the business. They can figure out what the starting point is. That's probably blessing a chosen vendor and putting together a policy which says things like ""don't upload healthcare patient data into the chatgpt UI"" or whatever is needed. Then the business as a whole goes from there, each doing their roles.

HR make sure policies are communicated, understood, and enforced. IT and InfoSec do whatever is needed to make the blessed tools accessible and limit access to the others, etc etc...

The businesses that treat this as just one person or departments job to ""do AI"" are the ones who won't find any benefit from it at all.

Do you want another department to manage AI in your organization? 

AI is like any other software/SaaS/product/etc. You can manage it, or someone else can manage it. The more tech tools are managed outside of IT, the less valuable IT is. Is that fair? No. Is that more work with no more compensation? Maybe. 

Broadly speaking, IT's role is to be smart about tech, and help the org make good technical decisions. Some of that involves managing tech directly, some of it involves being a trusted advisor. Both roles are really important. That's why all your vendors want to manage your systems and/or be your ""trusted advisor"". 

Give your advice. Recommend a program. Recommend training, project time, proofs-of-concept, and other stuff the IT team can do. Treat it like real work, that pushes out some other work. 

Whatever you do, don't sit on the sidelines."

1kqbe08,comment,mt5sl7i,1kqbe08,Zenin,,2025-05-20 02:03:11,1,"TL;DR - Yes, it's *VERY* much an IT problem.

Our vendors have been pushing it on us with free credit bribes, etc...because as IT we're where their money comes from.  I've been pushing back hard on a few fronts:

1. We're IT, we don't build projects we support them.  Get us *training* and on how to best deploy and support the AI applications we're sure Business will be throwing at us.  We don't want to be the roadblock to progress, but we're probably not going to be the driver.
2. Hey you the vendor: If there are good use cases for IT to be using AI directly (not just deploying/supporting it), surely you've already got some idea of those from your other customers?  Please give us some high level (no NDA info) examples of how IT using AI directly is helpful.  And then explain how those use cases aren't already being covered by features of the IT apps we do use today such as within CrowdStrike, etc.
3. What specific guardrails can we put around these AI tools?  AWS for example is telling us that Q Developer in the Console/CLI will have ""the permissions of the user"".  As someone with pretty extensive permissions...that sounds absolutely horrible.  Our TAM is currently going to get back to me on what limit policy, if any, we can put around Q to satisfy this.  For example I *do* want Q to be able to see most all resource meta data, metrics, and logs, but absolutely *not* see data within buckets, dynamo tables, etc.
4. Additionally talk to me about your *business* AI tools in depth for two reasons: First, because like I noted in #1 we'll probably be asked to deploy and support them, but Secondly because as IT *we* can probably be customers for these ""Business"" tools.  For example, Amazon Q for Business can train against our Confluence docs, past issues in Jira, Slack discussions, email threads, etc and possibly combine those knowledge bases with our monitoring data, etc and be able to help IT trace down and connect the dots around new trouble tickets more efficiently and effectively.  BUT...like #3...that's going to need some very solid and clear guardrails because we certainly can't have user A seeing data that only user B should have access to simply because user A was clever with their prompts or whatever.
5. ROIs on *everything*.  AI is stupidly expensive.  What's the story around proving what the business spends on this actually returns meaningful value?  In revenue, in time to market, in systems reliability, etc.  Can we trace per-user metrics of AI to see if/how it's being adapted and/or what results it does or doesn't bring?"
1kqbe08,comment,mt5w39u,1kqbe08,ultraspacedad,,2025-05-20 02:20:11,1,It's 100% Management that decides what AI Controls are needed moving forward. If they are asking you because they don't know and pushing it on you then good. Just make sure company Data is Private and if the Boss doesn't know just use best practices and pray
1kqbe08,comment,mt61dm5,1kqbe08,DaemosDaen,IT Swiss Army Knife,2025-05-20 02:46:12,1,"My answer is going to be ""It depends""

Each org has a different set to regulation, guidelines and requirements concerning data. Your bosses may not know what those all are since they rely on IT to keep them on the up and up. (Or at least to let them know and they ignore. Make sure you document it.)

So it could easily be on the IT Department to make a suggestion that gets sent and Lawyered up before becoming Polify.

Example:

I work for several Police Departments, due to the unreliable nature and the fact that the data leaves our reasonable control, it is not acceptable for CJIS data to be opened to it. I advised my Director then we advised the County Admin (my Primary employer) of this and now we have a lawyered up version of ""No AI at this time."" One of the cities I work for has already made their own Policy. Once I advised of the CJIS information, they decided to have use separate the data."

Right now, however, nobody really knows what ""AI"" actually means for businesses because it's being tossed into fucking everything by everyone.  This is probably not going to chance until we finally see corporate lawsuits from AI fallout slugging it out in court, or Boeing going under after AI designed planes start crashing or something equally crazy.

Even then, I suspect it's not going to be ""banning AI"" so much as just trying to regulate how it's used -- especially in regard to client data.  I'm seeing this a little in insurance and HIPAA industries but it's kind of vague, like there's a known concern about protected or client data being ingested in an AI model, but nobody is really sure how to even outline the risk or verify such an infraction.  So it gets mentioned as prohibited with zero guidance on *how*."

Most think it is solely an IT function to manage. Any policy or process which does not have backing of management, leadership, HR, etc, doesn't have any teeth. As IT you can guide the business leaders, HR and Legal to come up with policies for the business, but without a top-down approach it'll end up like your home lab.
