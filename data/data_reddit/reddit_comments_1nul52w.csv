【内容】
Let me thank everyone that stops to read this. I deeply value the time you’ve put into listening my rant. 

Quick disclosure here, my background consist of IT experience from the Army (25u) with a mixture of Sys Admin and help desk experience. 

As I view the job market and pick out different requirements I’m unsure that anything besides proven work experience will help me progress in this field. 

I’m wrapping up the cloud and network engineering degree from WGU, I got the certs, I’ve gotten my boots wet but I still feel unprepared for anything beyond the help desk. 

I’m curious to know if it’s a realistic expectation to go from the help desk to a network engineer or admin role with help desk experience, the degree and certs. 

Another big thing I’ve noticed is that most companies want you to show up and do. Not many companies seem to have an environment that’s offering mentorship / teachings for people coming into the role. 

Thoughts?

TLDR: I hold the following certs, and soon a BS in Cloud and Network Engineering. Is it a realistic to jump from help desk to a Network / Engineer role with a combination of the 3. Admin/helpdesk experience, the degree and certs?

Needless to say. I’ll get to where I’m going eventually. 

Certifications:

CompTia
A+
Network+
Security+
Cloud+
Linux+ (started but may not complete)

ITILv4 Foundation 
Linux LPI Essentials

AZ-900  exam booked 
AZ-700 scheduled for next year 
CCNA scheduled for next summer

I knew a decent amount about standard Windows computers, and knew how to swap out simple hardware stuff. I was an office bitch at a small company and helped the IT guy setup dual monitors for about 50 workstations one day. About a month later I get called to the owners office and told that the IT guy is leaving and recommended me for the job. I actually turned them down, but they told me I'd be fine so I reluctantly  took it.

The IT guys parting words to me were ""Google is your best friend""

For the first year I had no idea what the fuck I was doing, but Google helped me figure it out. I still use it all the time. No one can possibly know everything about everything. I still have imposter syndrome sometimes, because there are many things that I've never worked with. 

I always tell other people that if I can do it, they can. I am not that smart. But I always want to learn. I don't need to remember everything I've done, there are many times that I have to lookup things that I have done before because the last time I did the same thing was a year ago. 

Don't worry, you'll be fine."

Part of my job responsibilities i to mentor and train other members of staff.  

I am delighted to teach you how and why we do things here.  
I can't wait to teach you about the specialized technology decisions we made to implement the levels of high-availability &amp; redundancy we wanted.  

But I want to layer this training ontop of the fundamental knowledge you walked in the door with.  

I don't want to explain to a new member of the network team what a subnet is or what the difference between static routing and dynamic routing is.  

We absolutely want you to walk in the door ready to perform basic duties.  

But we will also train you to go beyond that. The more you know how to do, the less I have to do myself. I am highly motivated to prepare you to do my job for me."

This should be the topic of some questions you ask employers during the interview process.  

*""What is the company's stance on professional development? Will I have access to a training budget?""*  

*""How does the organization handle technical escalations? If I have a problem that I am not able to solve in a timely manner, who can I escalate to?""*  

*""Does the company maintain vendor maintenance on production hardware?""*  

Here in our environment, managers are supposed to budget about $3k per FTE for training / professional development. But we tell staff to think like they have about $5k. This lets things balance out when Henry the Homebody just wants a $900 subscription to online training, while Wally the Worldtraveller finds yet another technology conference in Las Vegas that's going to end up costing $8K total.  

Here in our environment, all network equipment is required to remain under original manufacturer contracted support, and all members of the network team may open tickets for support directly with the vendor.  

You'd be surprised at how many large companies aren't doing those things.  


$3K per FTE for professional development per year, with no obligation that you work for us for an extra year or anything like that.  

How much better can you get at your job if you attend a Cisco or Microsoft or Amazon conference every year?"
1nul52w,comment,nh4j4nv,nh28p4f,pinkycatcher,,2025-10-01 11:16:07,6,"&gt; ""What is the company's stance on professional development? Will I have access to a training budget?"" 

I'm hiring to fill a position after we had a very successful intern this summer I was able to mentor and train. The only reason we have this position is because I've been the only person in the company that I've seen actively mentor someone and train someone beyond day 10 of working here.

Any applicant who asks this question gets bonus points because I want to see than in them. I also give them the full rundown that the company hasn't done much in the past, but I personally will do as much mentoring as I am able, and that my (relatively new) CFO also highly supports training and is working on improving it company wide. 

&gt; You'd be surprised at how many large companies aren't doing those things. 

Small company's too, I've brought this up multiple times with our director and executive level teams that I'm on, and it simply gets ignored and I cannot for the life of me understand why, so many of our problems are because our managers don't want to manage, they simply want to hire and do. 

I took a damn intern and with only an hour a day I was getting him to put out improvements that the company actually felt, what I could do if I had a team like some of these managers around me."

MSPs are shit shows but you will gain a lot of experience fast because they tend to throw anything and everything at you. Gain experience and more well respected certs, go out of your way to add value and start projects (set up automated Ansible backups for networking equipment for example). Once the job market improves run to something much better.

RHCSA is good to get something more entry level before cloud though. For someone with little to no experience in IT, it is a very strong cert to have on a resume that will open a lot of doors. It got me interviews with Fortune 500 companies. 

The reasons I went with RHCSA: 1) It was useful to the job I had before cloud. 2) it is the most respected associate level Linux cert period. 3) It is lab/performance based. 

My first cloud job was impressed by my RHCSA during interviews. Also Linux distros are very similar so the skills carryover, btw Rocky is a fork of Rhel…."

That changed after Red Hat pay walled their sourced code as closed source with a required subscription. I would only get the RHCSA if you support a RHEL environment. Most folks get their RHCSA after they had at least a couple years of experience working as a Linux Sysadmin, not the other way around. I use to work with Red Hat but not anymore that's Debian/Ubuntu. A lot of public Cloud have their own golden images that you can spin up. In Cloud, there is a lot of building and destroying rather than maintaining an existing VM or Kubernetes clusters."

Sure if you think you can 100% jump straight to cloud then LPI and a CKA is better. But if you have little to no experience RHCSA gives you more options.  Like it or not but certs get people’s resumes noticed which leads to more interviews. Yes some of the information is “overkill”, but who cares if it doubles your salary and provides job security. "

You take the the fundamentals you learn and apply them as best you can. Furthermore, just like in the military, ""I don't know"" isn't an excuse to give up.

The problem is, without that foundation, it’s hard to succeed or even understand what you’re doing day-to-day.

Mentorship does exist in some jobs, but those roles usually aren’t glamorous. They’re often entry-level positions where you have to grind through the basics. Personally, I’m glad I started that way: first on a help desk, then moving into desktop support, then into servers and network infrastructure. It took years, but I needed those years to build the foundation that I still rely on today."

The biggest factor in being successful is the willingness to move. Tons of opportunities around the DC area if you’re willing to be there. Hell, I got a sys admin job opportunity sent my way in bum fuck Iowa for $120k (makes sense why they had issues filling it, because who would want to move to Iowa) 

I was a 25B with helpdesk experience and home lab as a hobby. I ETSed and went back to school because I had two semesters left for my undergraduate. 

I decided to focus on school and work and the computer repair shop I worked at prior to the Army. 6 months prior to this, I went hard into applying for jobs. Set up the LinkedIn, set up clearancejobs account, joined the Signal Jobs Facebook group, and even submitted my resume to TEKSystems so they had it on file. 4 months into school, I get a call from TEKSystems about a sys admin role. I interview and get the job. Plus it actually pays the bills! My team is pretty great and they’ve been willing to teach me and help me out. Not all places just throw you to the wolves. 

And this was all with A+, NET+, and SEC+. Basic ass certs and my Army job experience. 


Start building your personal network now. If anything, post your LinkedIn on the Signal Jobs Facebook group."

I'm very happy to put you into a position to learn- but it can't come at the expense of someone having to hold your hand. What we typically look for is someone who may not have all the immediate knowledge, but has shown that they aren't helpless when put in a situation where they don't know something. Don't know terraform? Do not expect someone to walk you through how the syntax works. Shitty implementations are fine, that's what code reviews are for. 

A good onboarding regime, walk through, should be able to get most people at least in a position to ask the right questions. Mentorship is often more long term thinking, strategic process to your career- not tactical ""here's how to do xyz"""

But sooo many jobs around me are minimum wage TRASH. $15.50/hr GTFO of here. Having the piece of paper has at LEAST opened doors for $20-$25/hr jobs and to me that’s worth the $8k and time I spent on it. It keeps you from having to scrape the very bottom of the barrel of the job market. 🤮"
1nul52w,comment,nh5z6tv,1nul52w,renny7,,2025-10-01 19:07:41,3,"I think it depends on what you’re doing/have done in your help desk position. My first position was “desktop support” but after a couple years I was doing networking, firewall and server work. IT titles can be meaningless and tend to vary greatly. 

I think one of the biggest obstacles you’d have is the current job market seems to be garbage. If you can confidently speak on your knowledge, and projects you’ve done, whether home lab or on the job, I’d say you have a chance to make that leap. The hardest part may be getting the interview. 

Regarding training or mentorship. I’ve only hired for smaller teams, and mostly desktop support, but I always plan to train and mentor people I hire, though I don’t specifically say/talk about that during the interview. If the interviewee has the skills (people skills and the ability to troubleshoot are most important to me), I’m more than happy to train them up on whatever they’re interested in. It benefits me to have others able to do more work. It helps them to either move up, or eventually find a better opportunity, which is great either way. 

I would agree with people suggesting the MSP route. An example tho seems to line up pretty well with your experience… One of their engineers that I’ve worked with many times has less than half my years experience (I think 2 years engineer, 2 desktop support), a ton of certs, no degree, and makes a good amount more than me in a “director” position. Though my “director” tile is a joke to me considering we’re a 2.5 person team 🙄😂. 

Kind of rambling at this point, but lastly, I’ve felt prepared for any job I’ve started. Even when the systems are familiar, they’re always different. Use your base knowledge and google that shit."

Fast forward 4 long long years later (well it feels like a lifetime to me at this point lol) and I've been through several low level borderline non paying gigs, one good one that I got fired from for messing up, several startup contractual/consulting gigs in the interim, and now a fully fledged DevSecOps engineer position doing government contract work. I can't express how excited I am to be here. 

I'm expected to know everything and then some... But I'm just thrilled to be in the position. I'll tell ya, everywhere I've been so far, half the people have no idea what they're doing, 40% have a decent handle on thing, and the the rare 10% are rockstars who are just all around gurus at what they do. Find them and lean on em if they're willing. That's what I've done so far. I consider myself to be sometimes in the first half and sometimes in the 40%, depending on the day and the task lol.

It's not about the paper you have or the knowledge you have in any given area. It's about your willingness to take a ""no worries, I'll figure it out"" attitude and be constantly willing to learn learn learn. I feel like these days you are tasked with teaching yourself. But most of all be open to networking constantly. Meet people, talk to family who might know people, go to events, sell yourself and tell your story. Like I said, 4 years ago I was a chef and now I'm tasked with enhancing CICD and security for the government lol. I got there just by meeting people and then one random day someone will call you with an opportunity and you need to always be ready capitalize on it. 

A lot of days I feel like I have no business being where I am, but I looooove what I do and I always seem to figure it out because of that. All people care about is that you deliver.

TL;DR Network, be confident in being able to deliver, don't worry about your lack skills, and did I say network? Yea network like crazy. You'll figure it out, trust me. Most people feel under qualified to be where they are in my experience. If you are passionate and willing to constantly learn and adapt, it will fall into place for you."

Great for learning though. I’d go for an MSP and embrace that’s it’s going to suck but be way more fulfilling than tier 1 at a major company like Verizon or something

My biggest thing was to absorb as much information and learn as much as i could, while gather as much experience.  I would harness as much of what you learn in the military like planning, coordinating, implementing, leading and mentoring (especially if you were NCO).

It took me a minute to settle down with schooling, and finally landing a spot. Once i settle, thing naturally progress for me from helpdesk, network admin, leading helpdesk, to then finally taking over as IT manger. 

The biggest thing for you is to  gather much experience, while the cert complimenting your experience. 

Yes, company will want for you to show up and do , if you are applying for position with certain experience. For me it just came down with grab the bull by horn taking on the challenge , when they present themselves.

Once you get on a team the dynamics will change and what you read in the interview probably won't line up with what became upon hiring. 


You'll be fine. A lot can be learned by sitting in a meeting and paying attention too, even if you think it's boring.

NTT Data/State of Oklahoma had zero articles, no training, lack of any escalation beyond ""ask a manager.""

There's benefits and down-sides to both, but the ones with actual training classes and a plethora of internal resources are definitely dwindling.

&gt;

Again, you'll still need the higher end certs to even stare at the position, even if its a Jr. spot.  If you get certs for a helpdesk position, you'll be stuck in that position.  You still need experience.  I know of a person who's been in Network Engineering for 3+ yrs and he still asked 100+ questions.  After a while, I changed things up so he couldn't continue to have me give him On the job training.  Let's just say afterwards, he failed to land the full time position.

Very few companies give out Jr. Network positions.  So your talking about in reality, going after a normal Network position or a Sr Network position.  Neither of which are handed to people who don't put in the work.

What you may or may not realize is that a hiring manager rarely sees ""incomplete"" resumes.  Many go through 3rd party companies who filter the resumes down to 3 or 4.  How will the hiring manager get the resume when you only have two years of experience when your up against 100+ resumes?  Is it possible, yes.  Is it probable, no."

1nul52w,comment,nh22mpp,nh1y9e2,No_Zookeepergame2532,,2025-10-01 03:06:54,18,It's just classism in disguise. WGU is an actual affordable school for the average person compared to any other school with the SAME exact accreditation. And people frown on it. It's asinine.
1nul52w,comment,nh22wrn,nh22mpp,ClarkTheCoder,,2025-10-01 03:08:16,-17,"Yeah, because you don’t have to complete as much math and many case, it’s easy to get extension for assignments (try getting an extension in the workplace. It isn’t always possible or easy.) and everyone here can shit on it. All they want. I know it’s an unpopular opinion, but it’s definitely a common one among hiring managers so good luck with that!! :)"

The math is more is CS."
1nul52w,comment,nh23fdg,nh22wrn,FCs2vbt,,2025-10-01 03:10:48,14,"When is math used to the extent an abet accredited degree graduate would be able to use it, in IT? Your logic is strange."
1nul52w,comment,nh25d0f,nh22wrn,No_Zookeepergame2532,,2025-10-01 03:20:10,7,"What do you mean you dont have to complete as much math? The math requirements for both in-person school and WGU were exactly the same lmfao. You still have to take calc and you still have to take multiple discrete mathmatics classes. People get extensions for assignments at in-person schools EVERY day. In fact, WGU doesn't even HAVE extensions. If you dont complete what you need to in the time you have, that's a wrap, you fail the class. Much like real life. You have to learn to manage your time completely on your own, just like real life. 

Edit: im talking about WGU CS program. I dont know what math their IT program has, but i doubt ANY IT program has near as much as a CS program anyway. So it's a completely moot point for this person to even bring up because IT program's dont have a rigorous math requirement. It's all pretty simple math that we mostly already learn in high-school. (Discrete math aside)

Edit2: as a side note for anyone on the fence about online school, WGU subreddits talk about how they get hired AND get accepted in graduate programs ALL THE TIME. If you get rejected from a job for going to online school alone, it was a blessing. Imagine having to work with these people who think your education is shit just because it wasn't done from a traditional, debt-causing school."
1nul52w,comment,nh1zshh,nh1y9e2,ClarkTheCoder,,2025-10-01 02:53:10,-9,"You know why I judge it harshly? Because the OP casually bragged about finishing up an engineering degree (at least that’s how it read to me), but it’s not a real engineering degree. WGU does not offer real engineering degrees. Their programs are engineering technology or applied IT and can be completed without all necessary calculus or physics courses. They use the word engineer loosely but the content is closer to IT or coding bootcamps, not a real ABET accredited engineering program.

You may not agree, but many people see it this way, and therefore prefer to choose a candidate with a traditional four your degree."

As far as I am aware there are 0 abet accredited network engineering degrees, anywhere. On top of that, I would guess most who DO have an accredited abet engineering degree, are not applying for IT positions but rather applying for jobs within their respective degree fields. Who exactly are you looking for then?"

This is such nonsense. ""Engineering"" in the IT world almost never refers to ""real"" engineering, such as Chemical, Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical engineering.

This isn't a real criticism, and if you and other hiring managers are actively rejecting people because of this, then you're not qualified to be making hiring decisions."

College has very little to do with knowledge, no matter where you go. It’s a process, a hoop you jump through. When it comes to IT, everyone knows most of what people learn and know comes from outside of college."
1nul52w,comment,nh29k8j,nh22lgc,WannabeACICE,,2025-10-01 03:40:40,6,"You're just objectively wrong.

ABET accreditation does not matter when it comes to IT, as it's not an Engineering field.

Now, does that mean Network Engineering is a somewhat misleading title? Sure. However, that has nothing to do with WGU's legitimacy, and most Network Engineers aren't pretending to be CEs or EEs.

So, who cares? Surely, no hiring manager worth their salt does."

How is that a ""casual brag"" from OP? Also, they specified NETWORK engineering. If you take issue with that terminology, you'll have to start by addressing the last 40 years of IP networking culture rather than OP, because ""network engineer"" is a VERY common title in job listings.

Full accreditation isn't just handed out to any organization that wants it. Online schools have especially rigorous demands they have to meet in order to become fully accredited. I've gone to both brick and mortar AND online schools, and the curriculum is no different. I would say that the teaching was worse at the in-person school. But I mostly attribute that to going to a HUGE college where there is no way to have enough teachers to meet student demand. (Literally some classes were taught by students...no teacher involvement at all. And they SUCKED at it). This was the top ranked CS college in the  entire state too.

I personally see a self-motivated and self-starter oriented person when I see someone who did online college."

Your whole statement is ignorant. 

If you had valid points where you had various hires from WGU that were not able to perform compared to a graduate from another institution, then you may have a baseline to go off, but it sounds like you have primarily assumptions."

And most companies won’t say they want to basically sponser someone like you’re implying they should do, that’s how they’d end up with way under qualified people just trying to learn everything on the go.

Companies are realizing that paying the premium for talent is just worth it.

At 10% above the bare minimum I can get someone who can pass a background check and not cause random drama and show up sober.

At 20% above bare minimum I don't have to explain to them what DNS is.

At 30% above bare minimum level for the job. I can just avoid 80% of the mentoring/landholding/rework risk that comes from having redshirts on the task. 

at 40% above minimum salary I get someone who takes imitative and is VERY reachable in a pinch for an oncall rodeo 

at 50% above minimum I can forget they exist as problems just magically go away, and they are figuring out other people's problems who report to me. 

Above this you start to cross weird lines where:

1. I can straight up hire WAY fewer people (like at 200% I can avoid hiring 4 people potentially).  I can also remove the Jr Manger/Supervisor role

2. At 300% I can get rid of middle managers and run crazy fan out ratio's (Sure letr's have 15 people report to a director but it doesn't matter because they all manage themselves).

4. At 400% they spontaneously fix issues for the CIO of a fortune 500. 

5. At 500% They WILL consider killing someone if I ask... I mean ugh.... 



Paying premiums ""unlocks"" a LOT, and it's like the reverse of marginal returns. You get parabolic returns in many roles by hiring fewer people but paying them real wages. This sucks for early career as the ladders that existing staff engineers used to climb up are pulled up, but new ropes and elevators appear always in new areas."

Part of it is IT being less of a ""high Growth"" field and more of a ""mature field"". Growth fields you have to invest to train talent because ""it doesn't exist"" at any cost. 

I care for new people wanting in, but I'm also  kinda torn on this.

When I came into this field people had home labs, and learned a LOT self directed. You could ask someone to read a manual and they actually did it, or they carefully crafted google Fu to find response. 

Increasingly I'm seeing people expect to be 100% hand taught everything 1:1 or call support and expect them to it for them.
