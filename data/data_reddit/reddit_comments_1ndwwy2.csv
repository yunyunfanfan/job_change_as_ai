【内容】
I think it's time to demand 4 workday weeks. This is the way to combat adopting AI as a means to squeeze more from people, automation, unemployment, and ridiculous sparse in wages.  
Even chatGPT agrees. Time to lobby governments to make the change.

    AI and the IT sector paradox
    
    Promise: AI should reduce repetitive coding, documentation, testing, support—freeing developers to do more creative, higher-value work.
    
    Reality: Companies often use AI to reduce headcount while demanding more from those who remain, increasing burnout.
    
    Stress multiplier: Developers face pressure to learn AI tools quickly, maintain legacy systems, and prove they’re “10x” productive to justify their job security.
    
    Broader issue: Without systemic reform, automation always risks making workers more replaceable instead of more free."

Eventually the VC money dries up and the tools won't be so free anymore, and people will either give up on them or start spending comparable amounts on AI tokens as they were on developers.

Most of the code that has value has that value because it has automated someone out of a job. The environment it does this in is exactly the environment a coder operates in. The one industry that is absolutely the most vulnerable to long term permanent replacement by intellectual automation is the intellectual automation industry itself.

People used to say stuff like ""Sure, you can use a DAW to make music, but the you'll always need a musician."" That was wrong. Or ""Sure, you can use a computer to make an image or design a brochure, but you'll always need a graphic designer to actually do it."" Also wrong. The same thing is true of coding. 99% of what people do in code is not special at all, of the remaining 1% the computer is going to be better than humans a lot of the time. You're not going to be able to stay agile and pivot to new things forever, the ground you stand on to do that is going to disappear, and the few little perches that are left in the void are going to be the sole domain of kids between 18 and 25 who live a lower middle class existence in somewhere like Sao Palo or Smolensk.

Having said that, as long as one doesn't use AI too much for coming up with solutions, and uses AI to broaden skills, then AI is a very good tool. Smarter intellisense. That's how I think of AI. Might be outdated look/perspective, but at least keeps me on my toes and learning/growing"

Are you perhaps missing a ""/s""?"
1ndwwy2,comment,ndkso9j,ndkmj28,Altruistic-Beach7625,,2025-09-11 12:03:02,1,You demand 4 day work weeks because of ai. You combat ai to remove it. No ai=no excuse to reduce workweeks.

1ndwwy2,comment,ndkt8b1,ndkmjx8,Altruistic-Beach7625,,2025-09-11 12:07:01,6,Now you're just saying random shit. AI is a valid excuse to demand 4 day work weeks. You don't 'combat' that which gives you a reason to finally demand 4 day work weeks.

Edit: my mistake. I didn't express myself clearly in the original post

Edit2: thanks for catching that"

Holy fuck, is there a single popular Reddit post without some sort of seemingly-intentional grammatical error in the title?"

1ndwwy2,comment,ndnmbot,ndml5mm,Hobby101,,2025-09-12 00:04:10,1,"Many: baltic, Slavic, East Asian languages.

Actually, there are more languages that don't use articles than those that do."

Please let go of your death grip on obsolete grammatical nuance - write how you please, but you aren't anybody else's grammar teacher and putting folks down for how they express themselves is not a nice or productive way to act."

Outsourcing is a much bigger concern."
1ndwwy2,comment,ndnl3uu,1ndwwy2,ejrhonda79,,2025-09-11 23:58:13,1,"I work in IT sysadmin/devops. I've attempted to use AI for some small coding and all I've seen is the same information I can get in a regular google search. Also for the work that I do and problems I have to solve, there is no way (current) AI can find solutions to these problems. I work for a company with a highly customized self-built software suite. A lot of the fixes I do are creative, non-standard, fixes. I can't see an AI connecting the dots  to get these systems to work together."
1ndwwy2,comment,ndnpwik,ndnl3uu,Hobby101,,2025-09-12 00:21:46,1,"My experience with AI matches yours.
But how AI is ""killing IT"" is by ramping up expectations of how much can one person do.

Instead, ""hey look, we can use AI as a tool to help us to take care of boring stuff, so that we can finally go home on time""
Now we've got ""perfect! we have AI, now our underlings can do much more in less time! as well, we can cut staff in half"" situation. 

I've seen first hand where managers would be pushing AI blindly (lets use AI more, more efficient, yadd yadda), and then after talking to Microsoft representatives, they change the tune into: we talked to Microsoft, they told us AI is like intern, needs to be supervised, and not trusted""

Doh! you had to be told that?! Maybe because you are in IT management, but you are an MBA from some online university, and have no IT experience? Real story. *cough*Home Depot*cough*"
