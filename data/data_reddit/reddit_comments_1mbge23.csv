【内容】
Curious to hear how others are experiencing the IT job market right now. I’ve been seeing a lot of conversations about the field becoming oversaturated especially with more people entering tech chasing high salaries or remote work flexibility.

Are you seeing more competition for roles? Has the demand for sysadmins and IT pros actually slowed down? Or is it just shifting toward cloud, DevOps, and automation-heavy roles?

Honestly I’d love to hear your insights whether you’re hiring, job hunting, or just observing trends from within."
1mbge23,comment,n5lyffy,1mbge23,TahinWorks,,2025-07-28 21:58:11,253,"It would really help this thread if people post their generic location and industry. Linux sysadmins working for a F500 online retailer in the USA is a 100% different market than a Windows sysadmin working at a hospital in Ireland.

Rural Western US: professional services firms: Job market is great. Plenty of local companies giving in-person interviews at first call back."

Since finishing that I've switched employers twice every few years and I always had lots of positions to consider. I'm currently switching again and many of the positions are pretty good and I feel like I'm being wined and dined honestly.

With my last employer I'm halfway into IT Security which seems to be even more sought after than IT itself already, so maybe it also has to do with that.

If you have a passion for IT work, are not stupid and can sell yourself well you honestly will have a good time here."

I hired for few companies and the amount of people lying on their resume to get their foot in the door was insanity, even with certifications and degrees. They could not tell you basic networking protocols, tech stacks, difference between frontend and backend, hell even the difference between SSDs and HDDs let alone explaining what SAS drives do differently. It’s a tough market, but if you know your shit and strike some luck you’ll be golden albeit being able to talk jargon decently and know what things mean or at the very least google stuff."

I was laid off on March 13th from my last company where I was a Senior DevOps Engineer for 6 years. Was with the company for 11. I just finally got an offer, after over 120 applications, as a Systems Engineer. The offer was higher than I expected, but only 65% of what I was making at my last company. Everything I applied for told me I was either overqualified or underqualified for a job I did for 6 years.

I'm thankful I have a job, but the whole process was disheartening and had some major ups and downs.

For reference, I am in South Eastern PA. I was previously working remote, but now will have to be on-site. Luckily it is only 12 minutes from my house."

Before I was in IT, I worked with a guy that would lie about having a master’s degree. He didn’t want people knowing he went that far in school."
1mbge23,comment,n5mvglk,n5mrri6,[deleted],,2025-07-29 00:37:16,5,The funny thing to me about this thought process is that pretty much anyone regardless of skill level will jump for more money the idea that being overqualified will somehow change this is just asinine. Usually at lower level jobs the odds you lose the employee over them going to jail or getting addicted to drugs or getting engaged to a stripper or some early life crazy shit are higher too.
1mbge23,comment,n5p1sfr,n5mvglk,ThemesOfMurderBears,Lead Enterprise Engineer,2025-07-29 06:55:11,3,"Yeah but the reality is that a person with credentials that go beyond the job they are at is inherently going to be more likely to leave a position than a less senior person working at where their skill level is. I’m well beyond my MSP days and probably overqualified for a lot of that work now (depending on specifics). Yet I’d take an MSP job given no other choice, and I’d hightail it out of these as soon as something better came along."

I know a lot of people who stay where they are because they prefer perks that are not guaranteed. I'm reasonably certain that at this point in my IT career I am probably qualified to go out and find a higher paying job in the field, but I work from home 80% of the time, am permitted to flex my schedule in almost any weird way that I want, and if I tell my team that I'm not coming in my one day a week the worst pushback I might get is ""You feeling ok?"".

I'm not making bank here, under 6 figures in Chicago, but I make enough to pay all the bills and live comfortably with my wife. I wouldn't trade this for a 50% pay bump that meant I even risk having to go into the office every day and potentially am required to work 9-5, or that my employer might decide to start tracking my mouse activity or some other bullshit.

Everyone else can chase the $1 more but I prefer my happiness, thanks."

Identify why you want the “lower” role and why having that benefits you in your personal life. 

I had that exact question about candidate that I ultimately hired. He said, “My kids are about to graduate and move out so I want to spend as much time with them as possible and I’d love the shorter commute for the 5 years I have until I retire. I’ve had the title and the salary before and I’m not looking for that again.”

So I knew he was good for the five years until retirement and offered him the role. We actually got just over 6 years before he retired. 

I was wildly overqualified for a role I took pre-pandemic and noted in my cover letter that I was looking for more time to work on a degree, ride my motorcycle &amp; spend time enjoying life. I mentioned that I had an upcoming natural decision point in my life’s trajectory in 24 months giving them comfort that I was happy with the role and the pay for 24 months.

So many sankey diagrams of hundreds or thousands of applications. We all know each posting is getting hundreds of apps. Chances are some kind of AI is vetting it. If you apply to a company and don’t get a call. Tweak the resume and try again. Also be early. I think they are probably already to interview scheduling within 1-2 weeks. 

I have no name catching companies in my past. The most impressive thing imo on my resume isn’t even in my current roles toolset. My current role is at a major firm and I had no referral or network to draw on and got it after only a few tries.

I generally only put 2-5 apps in every few years and find something. And if I get an interview I am researching the company, branch, news whatever and bringing it to the interview. They make me nervous but the interviews the easy part. Getting the interview is the challenge. Tweak the resume and/or the format if you aren’t getting calls. It can look great but that doesn’t matter if only you or the computer are looking at it. Get the foot in the door to get eyes on it or a conversation.

I’ll end by saying maybe I’m lucky but I’m no one special on paper. Network helps a lot too. Most every job I got before my most recent one was leveraging an acquaintance but that’s not always a given and when it’s not, tailor the resume."

1mbge23,comment,n5m30yf,1mbge23,djgizmo,Netadmin,2025-07-28 22:21:32,3,"The reality is being a sys admin generalist , pc generalist, cloud generalist, or any general tech person is being superseded by AI / AI Agents.  While it may be done poorly now, the IDEA is there.  Same thing happened when manufacturing of cars started to become more automated. Initially the welds were terrible and inferior, but over time, it got better and better.  Now we have less humans on a car assembly line.

Instead of needing a team 5 sys admins, a network admin, and 10 help desk reps to reset passwords and restart printer queues all day, setting up / terming accounts, standing up vms.... you reduce that headcount by half. 3 sysadmins, no network admin, and 5 help desk reps, and the sysadmins now manage AI agents which do most of the work that the help desk was doing prior, allowing the 5 remaining reps to provide top tier customer service / training / or other physical hands on help.  The sysadmins check the logs for the AI agents weekly, and are alerted for problems/failures of those agents.

Even with expensive tooling, this is a massive money savings of $500k per year.... year after year, and in theory, a quality of life improvement for the persons IT serves and also for IT themselves to stop doing mundane.

This is causing a mass hold on hiring due to this carrot.

My suggestion for anyone wanting to get into IT, find something that interests you, and go deep into that niche.   Instead of just wanting to be a linux admin or Windows admin, you should look how you can design a ""1 click"" deploy domain controller, dhcp server, print server, dns server, nps server, and CA to be able to expand a company

Does this mean you need to be expert in all of those things.... probably not, but if you're going to be windows based admin, go balls deep.

On prem AD is going away in a LOT of orgs, both large and small.

I got lucky.   I fell into networking (after a LOT of pain of help desk) and have gone deeper into the rabbit hole. I've done some wierd things in networking which become permanent solutions.  (Like actually DST NAT targeting the broadcast address of a subnet to make WOL work across a different vlan)

However, eventually, I can see systems like Unifi, Netgear ProAV, and Extreme automating most of my work away to the point I'm only called in to troubleshoot things."

Add to that the accelerating growth of AI, and it's hard not to see a future where job growth in IS stagnates or even shrinks. As SaaS becomes the norm, I could foresee a future where infrastructure roles disappear entirely; either outsourced to consulting firms or managed by minimal in-house teams.

My take would be that within 10 years, most infrastructure-related positions will either be obsolete or heavily consolidated."

They would rather take the easy route with chasing high value certifications, but they slowly get filtered out as the length of time increases in the job market.

It used to be common thought that applicants were jumping every year to chase a higher a salary or the perfect job. But the reality is they've held the same position over the last 5 years in those short 9-12 month stints because they knew they would be let go because the employer learned that they can't do the job.

Nobody in this market should think they are above the entry-level positions. The skills you learn and develop in the first 5 years at the bottom is what will make you strong in the field."

Then by some miracle if they get the job, because of AI, they actually have a shot of doing the job. So yeah, competition is going to get a lot steeper.

Then, automation actually is king. So businesses are going to leverage AI to automate as many tasks as humanly possible to where, after a decade or so, as employee attrition just normally happens, they won’t fill the job openings anymore.

So basically, get the bag while you can because there won’t be a bag in a few years anymore. If you’re not automating these tasks that management finds so valuable, you will never be promoted to a “we can’t lose him” status and that’s it for you."

I've used varying degrees of effort through the apocation process. I've gotten about 12 interviews for local companies with a couple of final-round interviews. Haven't landed anything yet, but have several more interviews coming up this week and am quite hopeful.

My advice:
- Do not bother applying to remote positions unless you can tailor resumes within the first 10 minutes they're posted, or you know somebody. Not worth the effort with how flooded they are.
- Tailor your resume to EXACTLY what they're asking for. The resume sorting software is looking for keywords that they've usually included in the job posting. Skills &amp; experience.
- Some jobs have excellent pay for contracted positions. In the Madison, Wisconsin area I've came across and interviewed for jobs paying $34.50/hour. Don't sell yourself short for some cocksuckers paying &lt; $20 an hour to configure and deploy ServiceNow for an organization.

I was probably getting about 1 call back per month between November - March, but that picked up to around 2-4 calls per month from April - June. I was applying for positions across the entirety of the US. I even put on my resume that I was willing to relocate if needed, didn't seem to matter. 

Out of the call backs that I received, 4 ended up either in the final stage interview or job offered- 

- One of them was offering a very low salary for the position they were trying to fill, not including the 60 minute commute, so I passed on that one

- Second one got to the final (3rd) stage, but they ultimately went with someone externally that an internal employee recommended. This is the one that had over 330 application for the role. 

- Third offered me the position, but then ended up pulling the offer back and said they decided they were not going to fill that role anymore.
