Imagine an end user chatting an AI help desk about their printer issue. Or explaining how some program is doing some weird thing. GOD FORBID they pass along an actual error code.

AI is only good at content creation and content regurgitation. When it comes to hands-on tasks, thorough troubleshooting, etc, it falls short."

Calculators require user input to do anything. If we’re talking about the traditional sense of a calculator. Similar but not the same.

I’ve met plenty of empathetic people that aren’t very intelligent. You can teach computers to display empathy. That’s not a problem. I’ve seen it. 

Not sure what the first statement means. We are certainly aware of an artificial intelligence because we created it. We created it to mirror our intelligence. We feed it information and it can retain and process that information. It does mean it can’t make its own decisions because it lacks free will. Anything unexpected or intended we call a “glitch”."

The truth is shitty and crass implementations of AI are already doing damage to the entry level IT jobs that people need in order to build a foot hold into the tech industry. The danger in AI lies in a company thinking it can replace workers with it. Already so many companies that I have personal experience with are trying to replace QA teams, helpdesk teams, NOC teams and others with some half cocked AI model in an effort to save money. Can an AI replace me? No. Will a company try to? Yes."

A programmed set of ethical subroutines isn't enough to keep the equivalent of a cranky two year old who wants their bottle from potentially turning into a weapon of mass destruction.  How does AI develop a philosophy to guide itself by?  Answer:  it can't and it won't.  Humans will cheat, and try to fill in the blanks.  At that point, you've created either a monster (when it decides humanity has to go) or a slave (it will never evolve beyond its own potential and will forever be limited)."

At that point, the storage will all be in datacenters, and we can 100% build the capability to self-replace/repair without disruption.

Picture a disk failure triggering something like vMotion that drains the host, then the blade self-ejects from the rack, and CV-enabled robotics comes in and hot-swaps the drive.

CySA+, PCNSA)",2024-03-15 20:34:19,1,"The fears of ""AI"" (stop using marketing terms) of replacing a large amount of the workforce are vastly overstated. CAN it be a force multiplier? Absolutely. And is it going to reduce the need to have as many people in very specific roles? Yes. But these doom scenarios where half the population loses their job, it becomes sentient, or we have skynet are utter nonsense.

If you've actually ever used something like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Gemma, or other GPTs. You'll know they're only as good as the data they pull from. And the Internet as a whole has a lot of garbage. As an example, if you're taking code, straight out of an LLM, and not checking it, you shouldn't have a job writing code.

They are absolutely going to change things, querying documentation is going to be fantastic. Using it to query and obtain the data you want and format it the way you want, great! But this isn't the end of IT or development."

Maybe I am in denial though, but it seems logical to me."
1bepfu8,comment,kuzu079,1bepfu8,Ravens_Fury,,2024-03-15 22:23:32,1,I hope for all of our sakes AI can put up with end users like the IT community can.
1bepfu8,comment,kuzv4wg,1bepfu8,sciz00,,2024-03-15 22:30:23,1,"There is no doubt that AI will replace job year over year in the IT industry.  Most of the AI implementation deals with security and infrastructure at the moment, allowing those areas to streamline certain aspects and automate processes.  This could lead to less people in that sector over time as AI make it easier to accomplish tasks.  As a L1 help desk, I don't see it replacing that at the moment due to troubleshooting methodology and the manual labor requirements."

1bepfu8,comment,kv0lexk,1bepfu8,[deleted],,2024-03-16 01:00:12,1,"Ultimately AI is just another tool, I don't think its a threat to positions like sys admins, developers or any tech role that combines complex critical thinking and creativity. The roles that I think AI is threatening and damaging rn are the entry level jobs like helpdesk work and jobs in automation. I'll use my most recent tech position at NRTC (terrible company don't work there) as an example. They fired 60% of their QA team and replaced it with an AI. Its supposed to catch people not saying the right scripts, being rude to customers etc. It also watches your video from the call to try and catch you not doing your job correctly. As you can imagine, its a total shit show, The AI flags things incorrectly all the time, it will often fail your audit if the customer is upset and cussing, it also doesn't understand process of elimination and fails audits if you don't automatically know the solution to the customers problems.

As you can imagine this has caused turnover to triple  in the year since they implemented it. Its so bad they lowered starting wages for tier 1 and tier 2 positions down to $15 and $15.50 just to cover the cost of having to be constantly hire new people. (For those of you unaware of what the starting wage in these positions should be tier 1 starting around $20, tier 2 should be starting around $25-$30)


I think the danger with AI in the workplace is companies thinking it can replace workers with an AI model instead of leveraging it for what its supposed to be used for and what its really only capable of, making jobs easier by optimizing or eliminating low level tasks so a worker can devote more time and energy to higher level ones"

Soon we will need 1/10th the software devs we have now. I have multiple friends who are software engis that use it everyday and are worried to death about it.
