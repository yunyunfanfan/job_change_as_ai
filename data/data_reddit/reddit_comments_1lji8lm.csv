1lji8lm,post,1lji8lm,,gptgirlnextdoor,,2025-06-25 02:02:41,72,"【标题】With AI advancing so fast, is it still worth learning to code deeply?
【内容】
I’m currently learning to code as a complete beginner, but I’m starting to question how much depth I really need to go into especially with AI tools like ChatGPT making it easier to build and automate things without fully mastering the underlying code.

I don’t plan on becoming a software engineer. My goal is to build small projects and tools, maybe even prototypes. But I’m wondering if focusing more on how to effectively use AI with minimal coding knowledge might be the smarter route in 2025.

Curious to hear thoughts from this community:Is deep programming knowledge still essential, or are we heading toward a future where “AI fluency” matters more than traditional coding skills?"

Every time I see these types of posts it makes me cringe from the level of ignorance. Or people outside of tech that somehow think Programmers are at the most danger of having their job replaced. Programmers are in the safest position possible because they can go further in making products (and now can do it with a much smaller team). You mean to tell me I can now build the website with the cool UX/UI, the mobile app, the hardware, the desktop app, and the A.I. generated commercials possibly all by myself in less than a year for less than $20,000? (I can even get A.I. based Cybersecurity tools to evaluate and protect my app and server with log reports?) And you think my job is at risk compared to every other person in a company? Why would an experienced programmer with all the tools (most open source) at their disposal need to work for anyone in the first place? The only restriction for such a person is time and an idea of a product with a huge market need!  As long as the world isn't a utopia people will buy products to solve their problems.

Entry level roles may be taking a hit cause teams can shave down but the emergence of these tools means more opportunity for the startup route. Smaller team's for multitudes of billion dollar ideas rather than large clusters of engineers at one company. The coders or beginners panicking about A.I. are the ones that haven't realized this or haven't spent time looking at the bigger picture of a marketable product.

The person who owns a sports car and has mechanic skills to fix a sports car in the middle of the desert is in a better position than the person who only owns the broken down sports car. 

The day A.I. can develop an entire codebase is the day I have over 10+ streams of income as a solo developer who knows how to fix my own product. What are you talking about?"
1lji8lm,comment,mzl953a,mzkhmdq,Naus1987,,2025-06-25 05:50:57,6,"I think the real issue is that mediocre, bad, and lazy professionals are absolutely at risk of losing their jobs. And these are the people who are afraid. And since they're just not smart people they're also the most apt to jump to bullshit conclusions. 

It took me a bit to realize it, because as someone incredibly skilled within my own career field, I've always lived by the motto of ""just get better."" Want job security? Be a Dr. House. Be the best person in the building, and you'll have the freedom to cuss out your boss and know you'll never get fired. 

But these people who worry. They're not like me. They're probably not like you. They're worried because they're not the best at their job. They're probably not even above average. They're just looking for a get-rich-quick scheme type of paycheck. If I half ass coding, I can get a job I just show up to and make easy money. 

They don't even think about being competitive. They're NPCs. They just want to go to college get a degree and then be hand-held through the next stage of life. 

It's why so many of them are freaking out, because AI is a derailment of the status quo. It's scary, because they can't survive on merit alone. They rely on a system to keep them safe. To follow the rules and be protected. 

They will lose out. And they'll have no one but themselves to blame for being dumb, lazy, or complacent."

If someone wants to delude themselves into thinking they're awesome -- then they better be awesome. That's the solution, lol. Worried about ai taking your job? If you're awesome, then be awesome. Problem solved.

But that glosses over the truth right? I think people need to admit that they're handicapped. Or you can't help them.

\--

But yeah, you're also right, soft skills are important. When I teach people to be successful, I often mention that it's a mix of the two. If you're a God at either, you can cheese the system. But if you're not great at either then be somewhat good at both. 

Side rant. I get this issue a lot with programmers. They think all they need to be is a mediocre tech person. Not good enough. You have to be a God tier tech person, or you have to be mediocre with good soft skills, you can't just ignore them because of a mediocre skill set. Work on both.

And then the other side of the coin, those Gods (and often Goddesses) of soft skills. They can be dumb as a rock, but get cushy jobs just because being around them makes you feel amazing. 

============

I truly do think AI will just murder the mediocre scene. And those people will be screwed. I do not know how to help them. 

It's hard for me to empathize with them. I can sympathize, but I cannot relate. I was raised with the philosophy that you just keep working on something until you get good at it, but I've met a lot of people who despite their best efforts never improve. And I just don't know what to do when people plateau out. 

I run my own company, so I got good at switching and rotating people around to min/max their strengths and weaknesses. And again, I do greatly value soft skills, and I know how to slot those people. I won't know what to tell un-employed mediocre people when my business is nothing but me, the robots, the robot maintenance team (specialized skill), and some baller soft skill receptionists."

The only point is I can think of is self validation.

The reason it is important to learn math is not necessarily to learn how to solve math problems that a computer can easily solve but as a foundation to learn how to think critically in ways that a computer cannot.

The thought is that in the not so distant future, AI will learn to think critically in ways that surpass all human capabilities and therefore the analogy with math breaks down. So no, you should not learn any math past basic concepts because there is nothing to build towards that an easily accessible AI would not be able to achieve and surpass.

Of course, no problem with learning advanced math for fun."

1lji8lm,comment,mzk65sv,1lji8lm,Wiyry,,2025-06-25 02:40:24,21,"I have two answers for this: the short answer and the long answer.

I’ll give the short answer here but you can ask for the long answer if you want:

The short answer is yes, it is worth it. AI is really good at boilerplate code. It’s terrible at edge cases cause they’re unique. AI’s big flaw is that they struggle with new and novel tasks. If you’re working with a new programming language: AI is gonna struggle until a new model is made that has training data with said new language included.

This isn’t even to add in things like hallucinations, spirals, and outages. See, another issue with AI is that when it fails: it fails silently. Unless you can read code (I’ve had way too many issues with AI debuggers) you might end up stuck. AI can get locked into what I call “tantrum spirals” where it just regurgitates the same problematic code chunk back at me over and over again (even after starting a new chat and clearing everything). Finally, AI can have outages since ya know, it’s on the internet.

Just using AI to code can get you 50%-70% there but the last 50%-30% really matters. You still need to understand what your code is actually doing and how to maintain and fix it when needed (as well as update it).

Trust me as someone who’s made a LLM, studied LLM’s, programmed apps and games, etc. a deep understanding of programming will take you farther with AI than someone who only knows the basics."

Well sure but this analysis is incomplete without considering the opportunity costs.

AI like op said is just a co-pilot for coders and it’s hard to see it get past that stage bc even I have tried to use AI for projects and again since I don’t want to regurgitate what the other guy said, basically it goes on loops and loops and it never gets it right fully so you need to have a good understanding of coding to be able to fix whatever issues the AI presents which tends to be a lot.

See how Walmart is the largest employer in the US? Walmart doesn't even need AI to the same degree, for example. Differences between Walmart and Google Inc., yada yada. But you see the point here. I don't know how wrong I am, but as long as AI still has flaws, which it always will, people can make a dent. AI learns from us and can't be better than us, since we aren't perfect ourselves, for a little longer. Not saying people can be better workers than a robot that can work tirelessly 24/7, either. But I'm probably doing something right by reviewing AI-generated code and selling websites to local businesses while having a whiteboard filled with various ideas. The startup route persists if jobs start to diminish. That is why video game development is likely not going to die out either.

I hate how so many people, not just in this sub, like to talk about the problems and flaws in whatever is going on and get flabbergasted when confronted with these questions. It's never been a better time to know how to code. There's probably some dude out there relying solely on those little suggestions that IDEs give you, and you just press Tab and make a living off that.

I am a physical therapist and I get job offers daily and work assignments to travel the world and they pay everything, housing, food stipend, cell phone, etc etc and I get a very nice paycheck to work in a trauma ICU with some very cool cases daily since my forte is gunshot wounds  and brain injury. I love AI and it fascinates me and the new emerging field of healthcare AI is going to be huge. 
So bottom line, go put in the legwork and become an occupational therapist, speech therapist or physical therapist. These jobs are only growing and blend it with AI technology for healthcare.

Some companies use frameworks and built tools they don’t need to fully understand them to make a product. But for bigger companies like Netflix or a big social network site you will need experts. I am still not saying you need to know things deeply but if you can’t afford to pay an expert and only use AI then let me ask you this. Are you smart enough to fix a problem your program runs into when your application no longer works for whatever reason and users or clients are breathing down your neck on the issue? Are you lucky enough that AI can solve all the issues you will encounter in time once your application scales up?

No one is denying that the paradigm seems to be shifting, but this notion that AI will magically save your tech-debt-ridden codebase in X years is a hefty gamble. There's also the harsh reality that you may not be good enough, even while ""vibe coding"", to build anything worthy of the market.

1lji8lm,comment,nm4rupq,n01otf8,Present_One_9426,,2025-10-30 11:28:38,1,"But I don't think anyone in their right mind would try and use AI in that way and think it's going to build anything serious. The point is, you don't need to have the technical ability to write your own code anymore if you understand structure, understand the language (basics), how to think logically, how to articulate your vision to a prompt and you will do fairly good.

  
For example, if you go on ChatGPT right now and say you want to create a backend for whatever using Python, if you're able to explain how you want it to function, user flow and ask it to create a roadmap and you keep refining that roadmap until it meets your satisfaction, you can then create something decent or more than decent (and know how to use an editor).

  
It's like if you tell AI to write an email to your workplace saying you'll be off today due to being ill, it's going to write a very generic email. However, if you go into more detail, tell the prompt what specifics to include, the tonality, how easy it should be to read, the length of the email, the structure in case you want to entice a response or no response, basically giving itall the instructions to create the email EXACTLY as you envision it specifically for you, it will no longer look like that generic email. Then it can spit out a v1 and you can keep refining it as much as you want without ever having to write the mail yourself.

  
Now if you know how to write emails, AI then becomes your assistant because you can take a basic template or even a detailed one and remove things, keep certain things, rewrite certain parts to appeal to emotion and garner sympathy etc... that's the equivalent of at least understanding the basics of whatever language in programming while having AI to back you up vs simply saying, ""here, create another version of x from scratch""."
1lji8lm,comment,nmd2aa7,nm4rupq,RemoveHealthy,,2025-10-31 20:52:29,1,"Why do you compare writing email and coding? :) Email is super abstract thing that needs no precision. Coding is super precise thing, that is why we can't code with human language. AI is trying to be that bridge between our language and coding language, which is cool but it can't solve unique problems. So when you will start making unique ideas AI will fail you 100 times out of 100 times. I like to make comparisons with images. AI can make you any illustration you want, because it has millions of examples. Now if you ask AI to create a unique car with unique door that opens up in unique way and show few images from different angles and precise blue print how that door works. It will fail every single time. It can't think. You can prompt whatever you want it will not solve that problem. Same with coding, if you are making whatever was done billions times sure it will find examples but once you will reach parts with unique problems you will be stuck and no prompting will help you get out of it unless you actually know how to do it yourself"

1. The joy of learning a new craft
2. For a deeper understanding of what the AI gives you
3. For being able to spot errors in either execution of the program or in the code and possibly fix them yourself without being dependent on the AI getting it right
4. Depending on what languages and frameworks you are working with, the AI may or may not have a good enough mastery, and unless you want to wait for it to catch up (which can take quite some time), you could deploy your own skills to implement your feature or fix the bug you are dealing with."

Now, I knew the issue but wanted to see if AI would pick up on it and how long it would take. After several screenshots of the error when i tried to import a CSV file it never picked up on it. Now I'm sure with maybe 10-20 more tries, maybe it would have but noticing that the VenV, interpreter and a new SSD wasn't in sync is very basic lol Some of the error issues would take AI 40 minutes of trial and error while you could figure it out in a split second which is why AI is best used once you have at least a foundational-level knowledge"

At the same time, the rise of AI will likely bring significant disruption for most people.

The problem with all this is how society/the economy is structured. Ideally, we don't have a good environment for us (humans) and ai existing together. We have a capitalistic world, build on ego and greed. Which if any hyper intelligent being is to rule, they will realize we are ants. 

We need to focus on progress in a healthy way, which unites us and we might be able to work with AI. That's my rundown in a nutshell. It's depressing but also very motivating."

Software has to stay flexible. Changing and optimizing generated code will be the key skill for the vast majority of software engineers. 

  
Designing Architecture and Systems with data pipelines will be the key skill for the very experienced engineers. 

So the point is: 

The Abstraction of a real world problem, to a flexible and fragmented Solution in a Software System, that consists of multiple abstraction layers is the true job of a Software Engineer.

1lji8lm,comment,mzk9qvl,1lji8lm,jeveret,,2025-06-25 02:57:24,3,"I look at ai as a force multiplier. Humans can hold 2-3 ideas at most in their head at the same time. Ai can do millions, but it still is terrible at creating and managing a single idea. So long as you feed it a basic “good” idea, it can do “wonders” with it. But it’s fundamentally important that you understand how each individual idea works and what makes it good or bad. So long as you can understand the single core  concept and how it relates to others, then ai is an amazing tool to expand that ability nearly infinitely. 

But atleast today, it still requires a human to guide it. Think of yourself as a manager, and imagine having a manager that has no idea what you do or how you do it…

Now imagine a manager who is not nearly  as productive as you are at your job, they are really slow and not technically capable, but they really understand fundamentally what you do, and what you need to to do it, and can use that understanding to manage an entire workforce employing that deep understanding of the work."

1lji8lm,comment,mzkbq6a,1lji8lm,heavy-minium,,2025-06-25 03:06:59,2,"Depends on what you think coding deeply is, so I'll make a definition here. 

Most programmers work on Line Of Business applications, data entry, web applications, SaaS platform, websites, process automation, etc... In those jobs you rarely get the occasion to work on something that truly goes deep. These are the jobs that probably would get replaced by AI first. Don't get me wrong - there are many interesting challenges here too, but they are not necessarily coding challenges.

The jobs where you go really deep into coding are less abundant. It's the stuff like writing a compression library, databases, software development tools, game development, simulations, or writing libraries/frameworks that will end up being used by somebody who doesn't go deep into coding. For those things, AI isn't really useful right now. That's even more true when the stuff you are working on is highly interactive or an unending thirst for more complexity/higher-quality. Game development would be an example - it's too stateful, you have a lot going on and a game loop that will run at least 60 times a second - AI may not even be able to think of what the output of a vertex/fragment shader might look like, and neither for a simulation where you have code running on the GPU dispatching draw calls to the GPU. And even if AI was able to replace certain work, it would only lead to even more complex games because we always want even better and more complex games.

So my answer to the question would be that you might not need deep programming knowledge anymore for the first kind of job I mentioned, but you will probably still need it for the later. 

And my thought on the overall topic is that the future with AI will probably suck for pure coders that don't enjoy the other tasks going around in software development. However, the more you love about software development in general (and not just coding), the least impacted you will be by future AI developments."

I didn’t know shit years ago and not knowing concepts and what can be done and what workflows and how things connect really helps you connect “ideas” in your brain to make any sort of workflow. Otherwise, it was a lot harder when I knew nothing, no naming definitions, modules etc really basic stuff and it just got MESSY! 

It’s good to have a critical thinking brain. You can invent things much easier and connect the dots on not just programming but other things that could relate to it. 3d printing, pcb, soldering, electronics and energy, building structures, plumbing. Like… oh man. You can do anything! 

The fun thing is, I just have AI teach me as well when I make scripts. Like why does that happen? What does this like do? You can ask a million questions (double check if it’s correct by asking it to go online etc etc) and not feel embarrassed or wasting a professors time. 

It’s amazing, but yeah the scary part is when it exponentially explodes which will happen, then us as humans will never catch up. Regulations are needed for that, and no one is doing anything but the opposite in that part."

=================

As a professional and traditional artist for 30 years. I can tell you that having learned to draw and knowing how to draw greatly improves my ability to use AI art. I know how to prompt things better with creative experience. I didn't know how to phrase that. But if I want to render a pose, but don't know the pose. I know other poses similar and can tweak it. 

Additionally, I can straight up draw character outlines and have AI replicate it with better detail. I can also pin-point edit specific details and make touch ups and clean up errors without messing with anything else. 

I think a traditional artist using AI will be able to run circles around a non-artist using AI.

More specifically I was doing some stuff so I could get websockets which is like a 2 way connection you see it in all multiplayer games scoreboards. in my system. 

EVERY SINGLE TIME I GAVE IT TO AN AI IT DIDNT DO IT. 

No matter the prompt engineering It just didn’t do it properly. I eventually gave up and did it myself. That was a few hours of my life that was simply gone. 

As I’ve become older. I’ve realised how junk llm code can be. It can work but be absolutely terrible. 

It’s a blessing to have it but it still isn’t at the point where it beats programmers. If you are ultimately interested in llms and their development or adopting it as your little assistant don’t look at benchmarks use it and if it works for your use case then great use it. 


TLDR: probably better to just learn to code and use llms as helpers not your main tool"

When we build software, we implement frameworks and apis .  Depending on the usage requirements of those dependencies, coding practices and framework specific syntax can’t usually just be known.  It has to be researched.  So instead of pouring over their white papers for a day, and assembling the functionality from scratch, I can ask ChatGPT for an example.  That’s an effective way of reaching the same goal with minimal effort.  You still need to understand how coding environments work, how compilers, interpreters and operating environments interact with your project, and how your solution accomplishes the goals in your project scopes.  In business applications,  you will often have desktop software or crm integration with storefronts and communication channels.  Yes.

I’m gonna get shit for this specially due to lack of expertise, but I’m going to give you my take on AI’s future in general.

I don’t think it’s worth learning it in depth anymore. Just a good amount of fundamentals because whatever happens, you’ll always benefit from knowing how the ‘system’ works and behaves.

But as someone who’s used AI to code algorithms, complex video games, linux softwares, even full shopping websites and modifying web servers, etc I’m going to say that programmers are going to lose their jobs FAR faster than they like to think.

What’s the goal of AI - and there are very few outlandish goals we haven’t been able to achieve, and much sooner than we expected - is to become its own agent.

AI is not a TOOL like many like to say. It’s not like a computer or internet. It will eventually be able to work and improve under its own supervision, make its own decisions and fix its own errors!

If by now, you don’t think we’re heading towards that direction, I don’t think you’ve been paying enough attention.

And no, it won’t take 10-20 or 30 (lol) years. More like 1-2 if not less.

The progress is RAPID. It’s far beyond the rate at which we can even try to adapt to.

Today they say “oh we have no idea how to pull that off” but 5-6 months from now, that has changed.

There has never been such a massive investment and accumulation of expertise by people from all walks of life - most specially state leaders - towards a new thing (and yes, I understand we’ve had AI for decades. I’m talking about the kind that we’re working with today. Otherwise every invention has technically existed for centuries if we want to talk about its very root that didn’t even remotely resemble what it is today lol) . 

That’s because AI isn’t a revolution in tech or tools.
AI is an *evolution* of humans!

It’s the next generation of US, not tech.


I read so many coders go “it can’t even do xyz.” Or “it takes too long” or “it has bugs” or “it doesn’t work well with new languages until the next model”

How far have we come in the last 1-2 years? 
Now factor in exponential growth in advancements and imagine where it’ll be 2 years from now.

When somebody asks “is it worth it to learn xyz” they’re asking about the potential FUTURE of it. So when people respond with how it is today, it tells me that they’re trying to comfort themselves by turning a blind eye to what - by all appearances - seems to be inevitable.


Do y’all really think a few years from now, we’ll still be waiting for the next model to have learned a new language or data? Seriously?
Is that how you really see things in a few years?

Are we not even trying to recognize patterns of advancement?

In a few years, models will be learning LIVE by acquiring continuously growing data on their own.

It won’t be once in a couple months (or once a week as it is today with coding agents!!)

How do I know that? Well, it’s very VERY hard to imagine otherwise. It’d be more of a stretch to think we’ll still have 1 update per month or 2 in the near future.


There you have it. I tried to debunk every single prominent argument for why AI won’t be a death sentence for jobs - specially coders.


Oh there’s one last argument.
“There’ll always be a need for humans to supervise AI because AI isn’t reliable”

As if humans are very reliable or will be even remotely as reliable in a few years lol
But that’s not even the main counterpoint.
You should be able to debunk that one based on my previous points. It’s in the same ballpark."
1lji8lm,comment,nm4ptq8,1lji8lm,Present_One_9426,,2025-10-30 11:15:12,1,"The one thing that's missing from many of these replies is addressing the ""why"". 



If your goals are to build basic to advanced tools for yourself or even basic to intermediate projects, you don't need to know more than the very basics, understanding how to think in terms of structure &amp; problem-solving. At the bare minimum, you should be able to work your way around an editor and clearly articulate your vision to whatever AI or prompt you're using. The good thing is, a lot of these AI Prompts will give you a step by step roadmap. Start there, make changes, and enhance it because this is where you're going to be more useful. Treat it as if that's your team of engineers and you're the project manager. Be clear, concise and detail-oriented because the output will be limited based on the input. Also, be familiar with the basics on the language such as the functions, data types, loops, variables etc... so at least you know what's going on but you don't need to write a single line of code.

  
If your goal is to build a startup or prototype, again, everything I said before applies here, at least to an MVP level.  You won't need to write a single line of code, however, when ChatGPT or whatever you use generates code, you should be able to know what's going on because then it'll allow you to at least tell ChatGPT to make changes to certain things instead of just accepting whatever it spits out. The more understanding that you have of a language, the more quality control you'll have. I know guys who can see lines of code and understand exactly what's going on but when it comes to writing the code to get it to achieve a specific goal, they may struggle. This is one of the great advantages of AI. You can become more of a ""technical"" project manager.

  
Now, if your goal is to become a software engineer or push things to serious levels of innovation, you'd be insane to think AI is sufficient. Furthermore, even if you want to go the Founder route, there's only so much that you'll know about the capabilities of programming languages and this is where advanced logic and even creating concepts from scratch becomes a real thing. AI for the most part will provide you with what already exists. Often, problem-solving as an engineer requires you to combine multiple things that aren't obvious or even logical for AI.

  
So, in a nutshell, surface to intermediate level? Learn the basics and how to think like a programmer and AI can do at least 80-100% of the rest especially the code-writing part.

  
Intermediate to high-level startup or tool(s)? Your knowledge should be at least at an intermediate level where you can comfortably code the foundation or basics of your tools or startup but AI for speed and then edit the code to your satisfaction.

  
The only time I'd say you NEED to be at an advanced and almost fluent level is when you're planning on making it a career. Most clients or jobs don't want to hire a software engineer that needs AI to do their job,"
1lji8lm,comment,npd1w7t,1lji8lm,Agreeable-Degree-814,,2025-11-18 02:55:52,1,"t’s getting harder and harder to see software engineering as a stable long-term career. Sure, you can still make money, but the direction the industry is headed in doesn’t look good. We, as software engineers, helped create the AI tools that are now replacing us faster than anyone expected. I’ve been in this field for 15 years, and until recently I never had trouble finding work. A close friend of mine, who has a computer science degree, over twenty years of experience, and published papers, also couldn’t land a job. We both ended up walking away from the industry and are now starting a business in trucking instead. For senior full stack engineers especially, everything has shifted. The deep troubleshooting, the problem solving, the complex work that used to define the job is now handled by AI. The role doesn’t feel respected the way it once did, even for people like me who were successful in it. In my honest opinion, if you want stability and don’t want to constantly worry about being replaced or burning out trying to keep up, you may want to reconsider this career path. Companies are pushing developers to deliver faster because of AI, and the whole profession is starting to feel more like a joke than a craft. With AI a random person can create a entire application, with a database, backend, and publish it LOL. AI will go gather all the business logic, colors, examples, spin up a server, publish it, host it.... Imagine where it will be in one more year. It would take an entire team to do this. Yes of course humans will still be used but we will eventually just be baby sitting and doing QA work against AI code. I pass after 15 years on to the next chapter. All IT related positions will eventually be replaced and very quickly. Massive layoffs coming and are already happening."
